## Descripton
During this assignment I:
Created a portfolio that sample's my previous work
I presented my name, a recent photo, links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
When one of the links are clicked in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When the UI scrolls to the work section, the first application is the largest
The layout adapts to various screens and devices
